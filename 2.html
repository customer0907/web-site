        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
        written in a
        markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a
        cornerstone
        technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
        This
        separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
        presentation
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
        file,
        which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to
        improve the
        page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
